          <strong>Athlinked</strong> is a platform (YASN) designed specifically
          for young athletes aged 8 to 18 to provide them an opportunity to
          realize their dreams of playing the sport(s) of their choice at the
          next level.
        </p>

        <p>
          According to the NCAA, only <strong>7 percent</strong> of high school
          football players compete at the college level. The number of players
          from high school competing in college basketball is less than{' '}
          <strong>4 percent</strong>. The recruiting landscape is very
          competitive with several thousands of high school athletes competing
          for a few thousand spots at the college level. Coaches and colleges do
          not have unlimited resources to scout every talented young athlete
          thereby leaving behind many talented prospects without an opportunity
          to pursue their dreams of playing at the next level.
        </p>

        <p>
          Without proper exposure through highlight videos, camps, or
          connections with coaches, talented athletes can easily be overlooked.
        </p>

        <p>
          This is the opportunity and space that <strong>Athlinked</strong> will
          address via an interactive web portal and app to bring athletes,
          coaches, colleges/universities and organizations on one platform to
          significantly increase visibility and engagement for key stakeholders.
        </p>

        <p>
          Student athletes can create detailed profiles showcasing their contact
          information, physical stats (height, weight), and a summary of their
          athletic testing results. Coaches will also have the ability to build
          his/her profile and his/her college/university profile in order to
          attract attention and interest to his/her program.
        </p>

        <p>
          In addition to being a platform to bring different stakeholders
          together, <strong>Athlinked</strong> is also working on a patented{' '}
          <strong>"Fit Finder"</strong> model that will provide
          athletes/coaches/colleges a selected list of matches that best fit the
          athlete profiles to coaches and college requirements for their teams.
        </p>

        <p>
          There are multiple recruitment platforms available today but{' '}
          <strong>Athlinked's</strong> patented <strong>"Fit Finder"</strong>{' '}
          and customized approach for different stakeholders makes it a unique
          and differentiated platform that will provide the best value for
          aspiring young athletes as well as for coaches and colleges.
